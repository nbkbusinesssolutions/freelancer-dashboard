🟥 PROMPT 1 — DATA MODEL EXTENSION (FOUNDATION)

👉 PASTE THIS INTO REPLIT AI

You are a senior frontend architect working inside an existing React + TypeScript app.

Your task is to extend the existing data models cleanly to support PHASE 1 features,
WITHOUT breaking existing functionality.

CONTEXT:
- The app already has Account Vault, Projects, AI Subscriptions, Services & Billing
- Uses localStorage (mock) + optional external API
- Uses TanStack React Query
- Uses TypeScript interfaces for models

TASK:
Add the following new concepts in a minimal, future-safe way:

1) ActionItem
Fields (locked):
- id: string
- text: string
- dueDate?: string
- completed: boolean
- context: { type: 'project' | 'client'; id: string }

2) AttentionState (enum / union):
- 'stable'
- 'review'
- 'action'
- 'risk'

3) Extend existing entities to include:
- Project.attentionState?: AttentionState
- AISubscription.attentionState?: AttentionState
- Renewal.attentionState?: AttentionState (if applicable)

RULES:
- Do NOT refactor existing logic
- Do NOT introduce global state libraries
- Follow existing patterns used in the app
- Update TypeScript types/interfaces only
- Update mock API storage shape if required

OUTPUT:
- Updated type definitions
- Notes on where data is stored (localStorage keys)
- No UI changes yet


✅ Result:
Your app now understands Actions + Attention, but nothing renders yet.

🟥 PROMPT 2 — UNIFIED PROJECT DETAIL PAGE (CORE FEATURE)

👉 PASTE THIS INTO REPLIT AI

You are a senior product-focused frontend engineer.

Implement a Unified Project Detail page that acts as a
single source of truth for each project.

CONTEXT:
- Projects list already exists
- Routing uses React Router
- AppShell layout already exists

TASK:
Create a new route and page:

Route:
- /projects/:projectId

Page:
- ProjectDetail.tsx

This page must aggregate, in ONE place:
1) Project core info (read-only summary)
2) Linked Account Vault emails
3) Linked AI subscriptions
4) Billing history related to this project
5) Inline Action Items (project context)
6) Project Log (if present)

RULES:
- No new API calls beyond existing hooks
- Reuse existing hooks (useProjects, useAISubscriptions, etc.)
- Use composition, not giant components
- Mobile-first layout
- Clean visual hierarchy (sections, not tabs unless necessary)

UI PRINCIPLES:
- This is a “thinking page”, not a form
- Readability > density
- Each section should answer a question

OUTPUT:
- New ProjectDetail page
- Routing update
- Clear component structure


✅ Result:
You can click a project → see everything that matters, without hopping pages.

🟥 PROMPT 3 — ACTION ITEMS (CONTEXTUAL, NOT TODO LIST)

👉 PASTE THIS INTO REPLIT AI

You are implementing a contextual Action Items system.

This is NOT a global todo list.

CONTEXT:
- Actions must always belong to a Project or Client
- Stored locally (localStorage)
- Lightweight, no scheduling engine

TASK:
Implement Action Items with:
- Inline display inside ProjectDetail and ClientDetail
- Ability to add, complete, and delete actions
- No separate "task manager" UI

Also add:
- A simple Actions overview page for triage

Rules:
- No priorities
- No tags
- No categories
- Just text, due date, completed state

Dashboard integration:
- Show only incomplete actions
- Sorted by due date

OUTPUT:
- useActions hook
- ActionItem UI components
- Dashboard integration


✅ Result:
You capture intent in context, not scattered notes.

🟥 PROMPT 4 — ATTENTION STATE (HUMAN OVERRIDE SYSTEM)

👉 PASTE THIS INTO REPLIT AI

Implement a manual Attention State system.

This is a HUMAN OVERRIDE, not automation.

CONTEXT:
- AttentionState enum already exists
- Used for Projects, AI Subscriptions, Renewals

TASK:
Add:
- A small Attention State selector (dropdown or badge control)
- Allowed states:
  - Stable
  - Review Soon
  - Action Required
  - At Risk

RULES:
- Default is Stable
- User can manually override at any time
- No auto-calculation logic for now

Dashboard behavior:
- Only show items that are NOT Stable
- Group by Attention State

OUTPUT:
- Attention selector UI
- State persistence
- Dashboard logic update


✅ Result:
Your dashboard shows what you feel is risky, not just what dates say.

🟧 PROMPT 5 — CLIENT DOSSIER (READ-ONLY INTELLIGENCE)

👉 PASTE THIS INTO REPLIT AI

Implement a Client Dossier page.

This is a READ-ONLY intelligence hub, not a CRM.

Route:
- /clients/:clientId

This page should show:
- Client contact info
- All projects for this client
- Billing summary (total + recent)
- Open Action Items

RULES:
- No pipelines
- No sales stages
- No follow-up automation

UI GOAL:
- Answer “Who is this client and what’s happening with them?” in under 10 seconds

OUTPUT:
- ClientDetail page
- Routing update
- Reuse existing data sources


✅ Result:
You’re never caught off-guard on a client call.

🟧 PROMPT 6 — FINANCIAL SNAPSHOT (MINIMAL & HONEST)

👉 PASTE THIS INTO REPLIT AI

Add a minimal Financial Snapshot.

CONTEXT:
- Services & Billing data is local-only
- This is not accounting software

TASK:
Compute and display:
- Revenue this month
- Upcoming costs (next 30 days)

RULES:
- No charts unless they improve decisions
- No projections
- No historical analytics

Dashboard placement:
- Small, calm section
- One glance clarity

OUTPUT:
- Financial computation helpers
- Dashboard UI section


✅ Result:
You know where money stands without stress or overthinking.

🟨 PROMPT 7 — PROJECT LOG (OPTIONAL, KEEP SIMPLE)

👉 PASTE THIS ONLY IF YOU WANT IT

Implement a Project Log feature.

CONTEXT:
- Chronological text-only log
- Per project
- Stored locally

Used for:
- Decisions made
- Client discussions
- Reasoning context

RULES:
- No editing past entries
- Append-only
- Timestamped
- Simple textarea input

OUTPUT:
- ProjectLog component
- Local persistence
