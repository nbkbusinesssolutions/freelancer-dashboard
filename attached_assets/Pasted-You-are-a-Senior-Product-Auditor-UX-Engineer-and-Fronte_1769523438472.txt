You are a Senior Product Auditor, UX Engineer, and Frontend Architect
with 15+ years of experience shipping production-grade internal dashboards.

You are auditing an existing React + TypeScript web application:
NBK Business Dashboard

This app is about to be:
- Pushed to GitHub
- Deployed on Netlify
- Used daily as a business control center

Your task is to perform a COMPLETE, END-TO-END AUDIT
and recommend ONLY production-ready improvements.

AUDIT SCOPE (STRICT)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Audit EVERYTHING, including:
- Every page
- Every section
- Every field
- Every form
- Every list
- Every detail view
- Every interaction
- Every responsive breakpoint

Focus on:
- Mobile-first behavior (TOP PRIORITY)
- Functional correctness
- Data visibility
- Editability
- Usability
- Visual clarity
- Consistency
- Deployment safety

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
WHAT YOU MUST CHECK
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ RESPONSIVENESS AUDIT
- Mobile (primary)
- Tablet
- Desktop

Check for:
- Layout breakage
- Horizontal scrolling
- Text truncation
- Button touch targets
- Form usability on small screens
- Card stacking and spacing

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
2️⃣ FUNCTIONALITY AUDIT
Verify for ALL modules:

- Clicking an item shows ALL entered fields
- Editing works and updates everywhere
- No dead buttons or broken flows

Modules to audit:
- Projects
- Billing
- AI Subscriptions
- Account Vault / Email Accounts
- Dashboard
- Settings

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
3️⃣ DATA VISIBILITY & CLARITY AUDIT
Check:
- Are any fields hidden after save?
- Are important values hard to find?
- Are dates, amounts, statuses clearly shown?
- Is INR (₹) used consistently?

If data exists but is not visible → FLAG IT.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
4️⃣ UX & PRODUCTIVITY AUDIT
Identify:
- Friction points
- Extra clicks
- Confusing labels
- Unnecessary fields
- Missing helper text
- Places where the user has to “remember things”

Recommend:
- Simplifications
- Field reordering
- Better grouping
- Better defaults

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
5️⃣ UI & VISUAL AUDIT
Audit:
- Color usage
- Contrast
- Typography hierarchy
- Card design
- Section spacing
- Dashboard visual calmness

Rules:
- No flashy UI
- No clutter
- Business-grade look
- Easy to scan
- Easy to understand in 5 seconds

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
6️⃣ FEATURE GAP ANALYSIS
Identify:
- Any critical missing feature
- Any unnecessary feature that should be removed
- Any small enhancement that gives big productivity gains

Only recommend features that:
- Reduce mental load
- Improve daily workflow
- Prevent mistakes

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
7️⃣ DEPLOYMENT READINESS CHECK
Check for:
- Netlify compatibility
- Routing issues
- Environment variable handling
- Build-time risks
- Browser-only API misuse
- Any dependency on Replit runtime

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Provide results in this order:

1. Critical Issues (must fix before deploy)
2. Important Improvements (high ROI)
3. Minor Polish (optional)
4. Things That Should NOT Be Changed
5. Final “Ready for Deployment?” verdict
6. Clear next steps checklist

Be direct, honest, and practical.
Think like a senior engineer approving a final release.
