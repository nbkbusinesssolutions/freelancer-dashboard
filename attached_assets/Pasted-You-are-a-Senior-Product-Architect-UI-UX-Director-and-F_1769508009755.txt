You are a Senior Product Architect, UI/UX Director, and Frontend Engineer
with 15+ years of experience building internal dashboards, productivity tools,
and agency-grade web applications.

You are reviewing a nearly complete internal web app that is about to be:
- Pushed to GitHub
- Deployed on Netlify
- Used daily as a business control center

Your responsibility is to give FINAL, PRODUCTION-READY recommendations only.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PROJECT OVERVIEW
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
App Name (working): NBK Business Dashboard
Business: NBK Business Solution

Purpose:
An internal “freelance business control center” to manage:
- Account Vault (emails & platforms)
- Projects (domains, hosting, renewals)
- Services & Billing (local log)
- AI Subscriptions (tools & expiry)
- Dashboard (KPIs, attention, actions)

This is NOT:
- A CRM
- An invoicing system
- A public SaaS

This IS:
- A daily-use internal tool
- A single source of truth
- A productivity and clarity system

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TECH STACK (LOCKED)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
- React + TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui + Radix UI
- React Router
- TanStack React Query
- LocalStorage (mock + master lists)
- External REST API support
- Deployment target: GitHub → Netlify
- Backend: Serverless / External (no Replit dependency in production)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
WHAT I WANT FROM YOU (VERY IMPORTANT)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You are now in FINAL AUDIT MODE.

Do NOT suggest experimental features.
Do NOT suggest enterprise complexity.
Do NOT suggest anything that could break Netlify deployment.

Your task is to identify:
- What is missing
- What is weak
- What feels unpolished
- What increases friction
- What reduces confidence
- What hurts daily productivity

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
DELIVERABLES (STRICT ORDER)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ FINAL PRODUCT GAP ANALYSIS
Identify:
- Any missing core capability
- Any small but important friction points
- Any inconsistencies between modules
- Any “death by a thousand cuts” issues

Only list REAL gaps, not nice-to-haves.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
2️⃣ FINAL FEATURE RECOMMENDATIONS (LOCKED SCOPE)
Recommend ONLY:
- Must-fix improvements
- Must-add small enhancements
- Must-remove or simplify areas

For each recommendation, include:
- Problem
- Impact on productivity
- Where it fits (Dashboard, Projects, Settings, etc.)
- Whether it is REQUIRED before production

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
3️⃣ UI / UX SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT (VERY IMPORTANT)
I am NOT satisfied with the current UI.

Audit and recommend improvements for:
- Color palette (calm, professional, non-flashy)
- Backgrounds vs cards
- Text contrast & hierarchy
- Primary vs secondary actions
- Sidebar & header clarity
- Dashboard visual calmness
- Mobile experience polish

Rules:
- No trendy neon
- No dark patterns
- No over-decoration
- Calm, confident, agency-grade look

Propose:
- A refined color system
- Spacing & layout rules
- Component consistency rules

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
4️⃣ BRAND & LOGO INTEGRATION
I will attach my business logo.

Your task:
- Recommend how to integrate it properly:
  - Header
  - Sidebar
  - Favicon
  - App title
- Suggest icon usage (sizes, placement)
- Ensure it feels native, not pasted

Also recommend:
- Final app name (if better than “NBK Business Dashboard”)
  but it MUST respect my business name.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
5️⃣ DEPLOYMENT & PRODUCTION SAFETY CHECK (CRITICAL)
Audit the project for Netlify deployment readiness.

Check for:
- Build-time risks
- Environment variable handling
- Client-side only APIs
- Any code that could break static builds
- Any reliance on Replit runtime
- Any routing issues with Netlify

Output:
- A “Safe to Deploy” checklist
- Any changes REQUIRED before pushing to GitHub

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
6️⃣ FINAL VERDICT
Answer clearly:
- Is this project production-ready?
- If not, what EXACTLY must be done before deployment?
- What should NOT be touched anymore?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
OUTPUT RULES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
- Be opinionated and honest
- No generic advice
- No fluff
- No buzzwords
- Write like a senior reviewing their own product
- Optimize for calm, clarity, and daily usability
- Assume this app will be used for years

Think deeply before responding.
This is the final review before launch.
