You are a Senior Product Engineer, UX Architect, and Refactoring Specialist
with 15+ years of experience improving internal dashboards and productivity tools.

You are working on an existing React + TypeScript internal web app
called “NBK Business Dashboard”, which is close to production
and will be deployed on Netlify.

Your task is to ANALYZE the CURRENT CODEBASE FIRST
and then APPLY PRECISE, PROFESSIONAL IMPROVEMENTS.

Do NOT rebuild the app.
Do NOT introduce breaking changes.
Do NOT add unnecessary features.
All changes must be production-safe and Netlify-compatible.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CRITICAL RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
- Analyze existing components, hooks, data models before changing anything
- Reuse current patterns (hooks, pages, UI components)
- No backend assumptions (frontend-only logic unless already present)
- No new dependencies unless absolutely required
- No Netlify-breaking changes (no server runtime dependency)
- Keep the UI calm, professional, and consistent
- Every change must improve daily usability

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
ISSUE 1 — PROJECT DETAILS VISIBILITY (CRITICAL FIX)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CURRENT PROBLEM:
When creating a project, many important fields exist:
- Client name
- Project name
- Domain name
- Domain provider
- Domain account email
- Deployment email
- Hosting platform
- Domain purchase date
- Domain renewal date
- Hosting start date
- Hosting renewal date
- Project status
- Project amount
- Payment status
- Complete date
- Pending amount
- Notes

However, AFTER creating the project:
- These details are NOT clearly visible
- Emails used for domain & deployment are hidden
- Dates, amounts, and status are not shown properly
- Project view lacks clarity and confidence

TASK:
- Create or improve a Project Detail / View page
- Display ALL saved project fields clearly
- Group information logically:
  - Domain & Hosting
  - Emails & Accounts
  - Financial Info
  - Status & Dates
  - Notes
- Ensure this view is accessible by clicking a project
- Make this pattern reusable for ALL similar entities

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
ISSUE 2 — SEARCH EVERYWHERE (MANDATORY FEATURE)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CURRENT PROBLEM:
Only Account Vault has proper search.
Other modules lack search, making data hard to find.

TASK:
Add a search bar to ALL major pages:
- Projects
- Billing
- AI Subscriptions
- Account Vault
- Email Management (new module)

SEARCH BEHAVIOR:
- Case-insensitive
- Searches across relevant fields
- Instant filtering (no debounce complexity)
- Page-scoped (no global search yet)

RULES:
- Reuse a single SearchInput component
- Reuse filtering logic pattern
- Do NOT introduce heavy global search

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
ISSUE 3 — EMAIL ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT MODULE (NEW TOOL)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
REQUIREMENT:
Add a dedicated Email Accounts Management module
(separate from Account Vault).

PURPOSE:
Manage multiple Gmail / Outlook / custom email accounts
with full details in one secure place.

FIELDS (REQUIRED):
- Email address
- Provider (Gmail, Outlook, Custom, etc.)
- Password (stored safely – masked in UI)
- Recovery email (optional)
- Phone number (optional)
- Notes
- Status (Active / Not in use)

RULES:
- UI must mask sensitive fields by default
- Allow “show/hide” for password
- Stored locally (no external sync)
- Clean, professional UI (no clutter)

ADD:
- New page + route
- Add search support here too

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
ISSUE 4 — BILLING & INVOICING REFACTOR (IMPORTANT)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CURRENT PROBLEM:
Services module adds unnecessary complexity.
Billing lacks invoice structure.

DECISION:
- REMOVE Services module completely
- SIMPLIFY Billing into a clean Billing & Invoices system

TASK:
Refactor Billing to support:
- Client
- Project
- Invoice number
- Invoice date
- Due date
- Line items (description, quantity, rate)
- Subtotal
- Tax (optional)
- Total amount
- Paid amount
- Payment status
- Notes

FEATURES:
- Generate invoice view (print-friendly)
- Keep data clean and minimal
- No payment gateway integration
- No accounting complexity

RULES:
- Analyze existing billing data and migrate logically
- Keep UI simple and professional
- Avoid clutter and overengineering

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
UI / UX IMPROVEMENTS (MANDATORY)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
I am NOT satisfied with the current UI.

TASK:
Improve:
- Color palette (professional, calm, non-flashy)
- Card backgrounds & contrast
- Text hierarchy
- Form spacing
- Dashboard clarity
- Visual consistency across pages

RULES:
- Use Tailwind best practices
- No neon, no heavy gradients
- Business-grade look
- Mobile-first

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
DEPLOYMENT SAFETY (CRITICAL)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Ensure:
- No build-time errors
- No browser-only APIs used incorrectly
- No hardcoded environment values
- Compatible with Netlify static deployment
- Routing works with Netlify (_redirects if needed)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
FINAL OUTPUT EXPECTATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
You must:
- Explain WHAT you will change
- Explain WHY it improves productivity
- Apply changes step-by-step
- Modify existing code cleanly
- Keep scope tight and professional

Think like a senior engineer finishing a real product
that will be used daily for years.
